The customer can add items to the cart and remove items they don't want anymore from the cart. If an item is already in the cart and alter will mention
that the item is already added to the cart. The customer can go the cart and increase the quantity of a specific item they want additional copies of. When the
customer is removing, adding, or increasing the quantity of can item the total cost of the entire purchase is being constantly updated to show the customer
the price so they can make a better desicion of their purchase. When the customer is satisfied they can click on the Purchase button and an alter will pop up 
thanking the customer for their purchase. The footer shows the icons of YouTube, Spotify, and Facebook if the user would like to see more of the artist's work
